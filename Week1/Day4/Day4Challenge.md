# Day 4 Challenge: Commit and Push Changes to GitHub

## Day 4 Goal: Learn to Commit and Push Changes from Local Machine to GitHub

Welcome to Day 4 of the 100 Days Coding Challenge! Today, we'll focus on the crucial Git commands for committing and pushing changes from your local machine to GitHub.

### Your Goals for Today:

1. **Open Cloned Repository in Visual Studio Code:**

   - Launch Visual Studio Code.
   - Open the cloned repository from your local machine.

2. **Add a New Folder and File:**

   - Inside the Visual Studio Code, create a new folder named `Day5`.
   - Inside the `Day5` folder, add a file named `day5challenge.txt`.
   - Write the text "Day 5 completed init" inside the file.

3. **Check Git Installation:**

   - Open your terminal or command prompt and type `git --version` to ensure Git is properly installed.

4. **Commit Changes:**

   - In the terminal, navigate to the root directory of your cloned repository.
   - Run `git status` to see the changes.
   - Run `git add .` to stage all changes.
   - Run `git commit -m "Add Day5 folder and day5challenge.txt"` to commit changes with a meaningful message.

5. **Push Changes to GitHub:**
   - Run `git push origin main` to push your changes to the GitHub repository.

### Explanation of Git Commands:

- **Add Command (`git add`):**

  - Stages changes for commit.
  - Example: `git add .` (stages all changes).

- **Commit Command (`git commit`):**

  - Records changes in the repository with a message.
  - Example: `git commit -m "Your commit message here"`.

- **Push Command (`git push`):**
  - Uploads local repository content to a remote repository.
  - Example: `git push origin main`.

### Story Time: Sending a Message to the GitHub Universe

Think of each commit and push as sending a message to the GitHub universe. You're letting everyone know what changes you made and why.
