# Day 1 Challenge

## Day 1 Goal: Understanding Github and Create a GitHub Account

Welcome to Day 1 of the 100 Days Coding Challenge! Today's goal is to familiarize yourself with GitHub and create your GitHub account.

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a powerful platform for version control and collaborative coding. It provides a space for developers to work together, track changes, and manage code repositories effectively.

### Your Goal for Today:

1. **Explore GitHub:**

   - Visit the [GitHub website](https://github.com/) and take a tour of the platform.
   - Familiarize yourself with key features, such as repositories, issues, and pull requests.

2. **Create a GitHub Account:**

   - If you don't have a GitHub account, [create one](https://github.com/join).
   - Follow the steps to set up your account, choosing a username, adding your email, and setting a secure password.

3. **Verify Your Email:**
   - After creating your account, check your email for a verification link from GitHub. Click on the link to complete the process.

### Why GitHub?

GitHub simplifies collaboration, allows for easy tracking of changes, and provides a platform for showcasing your coding projects. As you progress through this challenge, you'll harness the power of GitHub to share your code, contribute to repositories, and engage with the global coding community.

### Next Steps:

By now, you should understand what GitHub is, why it's essential for coding projects, and you should have your GitHub account. If you're already aware and have an account, congratulations! Mark today as completed.
